Read messages that have been on the system for up to three months from delivery will be archived and removed from your mailbox.

Statutory notices made available in this way by HMRC will have the same legal validity and implications as a paper statutory notice sent to you by post.

sa_printing_preference.tc.8.2.2=. Where this is the case you will be asked to provide this on screen.

You should keep the details of your registered email address up-to-date and notify HMRC of any changes.
sa_printing_preference.tc.8.3.1=8.3 If you give the consent referred to in paragraph
sa_printing_preference.tc.8.3.2=you may also be asked to register a telephone number with HMRC.
