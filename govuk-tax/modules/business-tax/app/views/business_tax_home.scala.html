    <h2>What do I need to do to see my tax account details:</h2>

    <p>You will need all the details you used to set up the services you are moving such as tax reference numbers and postcodes.</p>

    <p>To move your online services into one account please follow these steps:</p>

    <ul class="">
	<li>
	    <h3>Step 1</h3>
	    <p>Log in with the User ID for the online service you want to move, remove (de-enrol) the service(s) then log out of this account.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	    <h3>Step 2</h3>
	    <p>Log in again, this time with the User ID and password you want to use as your main account. On the 'Your HMRC services' page you will see a list of services you can add.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <h3>Step 3</h3>
	    <p>Select the service(s) you have just removed and enrol for them again, following the on-screen instructions.</p>
	</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the service you've added needs to be activated before you can use it HM Revenue & Customs will send a new activation code to the address held for you.</p>

    <p>When you have successfully moved your services, you will be able to see them on the 'Your HMRC services' page of your chosen account.</p>
