<h1>Pay your Employers PAYE</h1>

    <p>Companies with 250 or more employees must pay electronically.</p>

    <h2>Paying PAYE and class 1 National Insurance</h2>
    <p>You need your accounts office reference number to make a payments. You can find this on:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>the letter HMRC sent you when you first registered as an employer</li>
        <li>the letter HMRC sends you instead of a payment booklet</li>
      <li>the front of your payment booklet if you still get one</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You have to enter the number without gaps between the characters.</p>
    <p>All end of year balancing payments must show in month 12. You can only use month 13 to pay National Insurance class 1 you owe on your P11D.</p>

    <p>Use your company’s @{ePayeOnlineAccountLink.set(ID, "ePayeOnlineAccountHref1").set(TEXT, "HMRC online account").render} to set up a Direct Debit at least 5 working days before the payment is due.</p>
    <p>Once the Direct Debit is set up, payments will leave your account 3 days before they’re due. They’ll show on your statements as ‘HMRC NDDS’.</p>
